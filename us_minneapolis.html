    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    
    <p>Our community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and 
    experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When 
    you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions 
    and strive to keep our community a positive, successful, and growing community.</p>
    
    A member of the community is:

    <b>Open</b>

    <p>Members of the community are open to collaboration. We're receptive 
    to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our 
    efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate 
    and everyone can make a difference.</p>

    <b>Considerate</b>

    <p>Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other community members. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts 
    of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in 
    our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.</p>

    <b>Respectful</b>

    <p>Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, 
    and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate our community. We're respectful of the 
    processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.</p>

    <p>Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If 
    we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.</p>
